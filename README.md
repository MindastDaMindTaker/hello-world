This is the start of something beautiful

My name is Santino. I am a 29 year old tech lover who wants to become good at coding in more robust languages. I started coding in the 7th grade. At that time it was just HTML. As I advanced and learned over the years, I've added CSS and a little java to my knowledge base. I am still a beginner with all of this. HTML seems easy to me, but once I look at Java, PHP, Ruby, and Python, I get really confused at what to practice at. So this is a new step towards getting code savvy.
